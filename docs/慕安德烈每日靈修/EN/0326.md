## THE MERCY OF GOD ##

Scripture: "Oh, give thanks unto the Lord; for He is good: for His mercy endureth for ever."â€”Ps. cxxxvi. 1.



This Psalm is wholly devoted to the praise of God's mercy. In each of the twenty-six verses we have the expression; "His mercy endureth for ever." The Psalmist was full of this glad thought. Our hearts too should be filled with the blessed assurance. The everlasting, unchangeable mercy of God is cause for unceasing praise an thanksgiving.

Let us read what is said about God's mercy in the well-known Psalm ciii.

"Bless the Lord, O my soul: who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies" (ver. 4).

Of all God's other attributes, mercy is the crown. May it be a crown upon my head and in my life!

"The Lord is merciful and gracious, and plenteous in mercy" (ver. 8). As wonderful as God's greatness is, so infinite is His mercy.

"As the heaven is high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward them that fear Him" (ver. 11).

What a thought! As high as the heaven is above the earth, so immeasurably and inconceivably great is the mercy of God waiting to bestow His richest blessing.

"The mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him" (ver. 17).

Here again the psalmist speaks of God's boundless loving-kindness and mercy.

O my soul, how frequently we have read these familiar words without the least thought of their immeasurable greatness! Be still, and meditate until the heart responds in the words of Psalm xxxvi.:

"Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens."

"How excellent is Thy loving-kindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of Thy wings."

"Oh, continue Thy loving-kindness unto them that know Thee."

O my soul, take time to thank God with great joy for the wonderful mercy with which He crowns thy life, and say:

"Thy loving-kindness is better than life."
