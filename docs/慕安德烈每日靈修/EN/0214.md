## THE PLAGE OF PRAYER ##

Scripture: "These all continued with one accord in prayer and sup¬plication."—ACTS i. 14.



The last words which Christ spoke ere He left the world give us the four great notes of His Church: "Wait for the promise of the Father." "Ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you." "Ye shall be witnesses unto Me." "Both in Jerusalem and unto the uttermost parts of the earth."

United and unceasing prayer, the power of the Holy Spirit, living witnesses to the living Christ, from Jerusalem to the utter¬most part of the earth—such are the marks of the true Gospel, of the true ministry, of the true Church of the New Testament.

A Church of united and unceasing prayerfulness, a min¬istry filled with the Holy Spirit, the members living witnesses to a living Christ, with a message to every creature on earth— such was the Church that Christ founded, and such the Church that went out to conquer the world.

When Christ has ascended to heaven the disciples knew at once what their work was to be, continuing with one accord in prayer and supplication. They were to be bound together, by the love and Spirit of Christ, into one Body. It was this that gave them their wonderful power in heaven with God, and upon earth with men.

Their own duty was to wait in, united and unceasing prayer for the power of the Holy Spirit, as the enduement from on high for their witness to Christ to the ends of the earth. A praying Church, a Spirit-filled Church, a witnessing Church, with all the world as its sphere and aim—such is the Church of Jesus Christ.

As long as it maintained this character, it had power to conquer. But alas, as it came under the influence of the world, how much it lost of its heavenly, supernatural beauty and strength! How unfaithful in prayer, how feeble the workings of the Spirit, how formal its witness to Christ, and how unfaithful to its worldwide mission!

Blessed Lord Jesus, have mercy upon Thy Church, and give, we pray Thee, the Spirit of Prayer and supplication as of old, that Thy Church may prove what power from Thee rests upon her and her testimony for Thee, to win the world to Thy feet. AMEN.
