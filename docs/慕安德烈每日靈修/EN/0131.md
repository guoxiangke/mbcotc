## CHRIST IS ALL ##

Scripture: "Christ is all and in all."—COL. iii. 11.



In the eternal counsel of God, in the redemption on the cross, as King on the throne in heaven and on earth,—Christ is all! In the salvation of sinners, in their justification and sanctification, in the upbuilding of Christ's Body, in the care for individuals, even the most sinful,—this word avails, Christ is all. Every day and every hour, it affords comfort and strength to the child of God, who accepts it in faith:—Christ is all.

Have you perhaps thought in reading these pages that the full salvation here described is not meant for you? You feel too weak, too unworthy, too untrustworthy. My dear reader, do believe that if you will only accept the Lord Jesus in childlike faith, you have a leader and a guide who will supply all your need. Believe with your whole heart in the word of our Saviour: "Lo, I am with you always," and you will experience His presence each day. However cold and dull your feelings may be, how¬ever sinful you are, meet the Lord Jesus in secret, and He will reveal Himself to you. Tell Him how wretched you are, and then trust Him to help and sustain you. Wait before Him until by faith you can rejoice in Him. Read this book over again, and read it with the thought: Christ is all. I have failed to remember this, but each day as I go to secret prayer let this thought be with me: Christ is all. Let me take it as my motto,— to teach me to pray, to strengthen my faith, to give me the assur¬ance of His love, and access to the Father, to make me strong for the work of the day: Christ is all. Yes, Christ, my Christ, is all I need. It will teach me to abide in His love. It will give me the assurance that He dwells in my heart, and I may know the love that passes knowledge. God be praised to all eternity: Christ, my Christ, is my all in all!
