## MISSIONARY INTERCESSION ##

Scripture: "When they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away."â€”ACTS xiii. 3



How to multiply the number of Christians, who will individually and collectively wield this force of intercession for the conversion and transformation of men, that is the supreme question of Foreign Missions, Every other consideration and plan is secondary to that of wielding the forces of prayer."

"That those who love this work, and bear it upon their hearts will follow the Scriptural injunction to pray unceasingly for its triumph, we take for granted. To such, not only the Morning Watch and the hours of stated devotion, but all times and seasons will witness an attitude of intercession that refuses to let God go until He crowns His workers with victory."

Missions have their root in the love of Christ, as that was proved on the cross and now lives in our heart. As men are so earnest in seeking to carry out God's plans for the natural world, so God's children should be at least as wholehearted in seeking to bring Christ's love to all mankind. Intercession is the chief means appointed by God to bring the great redemption within the reach of all.

Pray for the missionaries, that the Christ-life may be clear and strong, that they may be men of prayer and filled with love, in whom the power of the spiritual life is made manifest.

Pray for the native Christians, that they may know the glory of the mystery among the heathen, Christ in them the hope of glory.

Pray for the baptism classes, and all the pupils in schools, that the teaching of God's Word may be in power. Pray specially for the native pastors and evangelists, that the Holy Spirit may fill them to be witnesses for Christ among their fellow-countrymen.

Pray, above all, for the Church of Christ, that it may be lifted out of its indifference, and that every believer may be brought to understand that the one object of his life is to help to make Christ King on the earth.

Our gracious God, our eyes are unto Thee. Wilt Thou not in mercy hear our prayer, and by the Holy Spirit reveal the presence and the power of Christ in thy work of Thy servants? AMEN.
