## THE DISCIPLES' PRAYER ##

Scripture: "These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplica¬tion."—ACTS i. 14. "They continued steadfastly in fellowship and in prayers."—ACTS ii. 42.



What a lesson it would be to us in the school of prayer to have a clear apprehension of what this continuing with one accord in prayer meant to the disciples.



Just think of the object of their desire. However defective the thoughts were that they had of the Blessed Spirit, this they knew, from the words of Jesus, "it is expedient for you that I go away," that the Spirit would give the glorified Christ into their very hearts in a way they had never known Him before. And it would be He Himself, in the mighty power of God's Spirit, Who would be their strength for the work to which He had called them.



With what confidence they expected the fulfilment of the promise. Had not the Master, who had loved them so well, given them the assurance of what He would send upon them from the throne of the Father in Heaven ?



And with what intensity and persistency they pleaded; in the midst of the praise and thanksgiving that filled their hearts as they worshipped their Lord in heaven, remembering all He had taught them about importunity, in the full assurance that however long the answer might be delayed, He would most assuredly fulfil their desires. Let us nourish our hearts with thoughts such as these, until we realize that the very same promise that was given to the disciples is given to us, and that we too, even though we have to cry day and night to God, can count upon the Father to answer our prayers.



And then, and this is not the least,—let us believe that as they continued with one accord in prayer, we also may unite as one man in presenting our petitions even though we cannot be-together in one place. We can—in the love wherewith His Spirit makes us one, and in the experience of our Lord's presence with each one who joins with His brethren in pleading the blessed Name—we can claim the promise that we too shall be filled with the Holy Ghost.
