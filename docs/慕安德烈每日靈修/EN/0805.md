## EXCEEDING ABUNDANTLY ##

Scripture: "Now unto Him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto Him be glory in the Church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen."—EPH. iii. 20, 21.



In the great prayer which Paul had just indited, he had apparently reached the highest expression possible of the life to which God's mighty power could bring the believer. But Paul is not content. In this doxology he rises still higher and lifts us up to give glory to God as "able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think." Pause a moment to think what that "exceeding abundantly" means.



Think of the words, "the exceeding great and precious prom¬ises." Think of "the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of the strength of His might which He wrought in Christ when He raised Him from the dead." Think of the grace of our Lord as exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus, so that where sin abounded grace did abound more exceedingly. He lifts our hearts to give glory to God as able to do "exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think," according to the greatness of that power which worketh in us, nothing less than the exceeding greatness of the power that raised Christ from the dead. And as our hearts begin to feel that there is here a prospect of something that God will work in us beyond all our imagination, He lifts our hearts to join in the universal chorus: "Unto Him be the glory in the Church and in Christ Jesus, unto all generations, for ever and ever. Amen."



As we worship and adore, the call comes to believe in this Almighty God, who is working in our hearts, according to His mighty power, able and willing to fulfil every one of His exceeding great and precious promises, and, where sin abounded, to prove that grace abounds more exceedingly.



Paul began his great prayer, "I bow my knees to the Father." He ends it by bringing us to our knees, to give glory to Him as able to fulfil every promise, to reveal Christ dwelling in our hearts, and keep us in that life of love which leads to being filled with all the fullness of God.



Child of God, bow in deep adoration, giving glory to God, until your heart learns to believe: the prayer will be fulfilled, Jesus Christ will dwell in my heart by faith. Faith in this Almighty God, and the exceeding abundance of His grace and power, will teach us that the abiding indwelling of Christ in the heart is the secret of the abiding presence.
