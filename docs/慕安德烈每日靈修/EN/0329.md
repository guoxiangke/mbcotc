## THE GLORY OF GOD ##

Scripture: "Unto Him be glory throughout all ages."—EPH. iii. 21.



God Himself must reveal His glory to us; then alone are we able to know and glorify Him aright.

There is no more wonderful image in nature of the glory of God than we find in the starry heavens. The telescopes, which are continually made more powerful, have long proclaimed the wonders of God's universe. And by means of photography, new wonders of that glory have been revealed. A photographic plate fixed below the telescope will reveal millions of stars, which could never have been seen by the eye through the best telescope. Man must step on one side, and allow the glory of the heavens to reveal itself; and the stars, at first wholly in¬visible, and at immense distances, will leave their image upon the plate.

What a lesson for the soul that longs to see the glory of God in His Word. Put aside your own efforts and thoughts. Let your heart be as a photographic plate that waits for God's glory to be revealed. The plate must be rightly prepared and clean; let your heart be prepared and purified by God's Spirit. "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." The plate must be immovable; let your heart be still before God. The plate must be exposed sometimes for seven or eight hours, to receive the full impression of the farthest stars; let your heart take time in silent waiting upon God, and He will reveal His glory.

If you keep silence before God and give Him time, He will put thoughts into your heart that may be of unspeakable blessing to yourself and others. He will create within you desires and dispositions that will indeed be as the rays of His glory shining in you.

Put this to the proof this morning. Offer your spirit to Him in deep humility, and have faith that God will reveal Himself in His holy love. His glory will descend upon you. You will yourself feel the need of giving Him full time to do His blessed work.

"The Lord is in His holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before Him."

"My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from Him."

"God hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus" (2 Cor. iv. 6).

"Be still, and know that I am God."
