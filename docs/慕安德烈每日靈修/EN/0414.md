## CHRIST'S LIFE IN US ##

Scripture: "Because I live, ye shall live also."—JOHN xiv. 19.



There is a great difference' in the teaching of the three first Evangelists and that of John. John was the bosom friend Of Jesus. He could understand the Master better than the others, and has recorded Christ's teaching, of which they say nothing. This makes John xiii.-xvii. the inmost sanctuary of the New Testament. The others could speak of repentance and the pardon of sin as the first great gift of the New Testament. But of the new life which the new covenant was to bring, with the new heart in which the law had been put as a living power, they say little. It is, John records, what Christ taught about His very own life really becoming ours, and our being united with Him just as He was with the Father. The other Evangelists speak of Christ as the Shepherd seeking and saving the lost. John speaks of Him as the Shepherd who so gives His life for the sheep, that His very life becomes theirs. "I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly" (John x. 10. R. V.).



And so Christ says here, "I live, and ye shall live also." The disciples were to receive from Him, not the life He then had, but the resurrection life in the power of its victory over death, and of His exaltation to the right hand of God. He would from thenceforth ever dwell in them; a new, a heavenly, an eternal life; the life of Jesus Himself should fill them. And this promise is to all who will accept it in faith.



Alas, how many there are who are content with the begin¬nings of the Christian life, but never long to have it in its fulness, the more abundant life! They do not believe in it; they are not ready for the sacrifice implied in being wholly filled with the life of Jesus. Child of God, the message comes again to you: "The things that are impossible with men are possible with God." I pray you, do take time, and let Christ's wonderful promise take possession of your heart. Be content with noth¬ing less than a full salvation, Christ living in you, and you living in Christ. Be assured that it is meant for everyone who will take time to listen to Christ's promises, and will believe that the Almighty power of God will work in him the mighty wonder of His grace—Christ dwelling in the heart by faith.
