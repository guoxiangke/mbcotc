## FOLLOWING THE LAMB ##

Scripture: "These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth. These were purchased from among men, to be the first-fruits unto God and unto the Lamb."â€”REV. xiv. 4.



The Lamb is the Leader of whom it was written: "For it became Him ... in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings" (Heb. ii. 10). He was "the Author and Perfecter of our faith . . . . who endured the Cross" (Heb. xii. 2).



Let us consider:



The Lamb as our Leader and Example; and His redeemed ones, who follow Him whithersoever He goeth.



The Lamb in His great humility, who says: "Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly of heart."



The Lamb in His perfect innocence and purity.



The Lamb in His patience and silence: "He was brought as a Lamb to the slaughter."



The Lamb who offered Himself to God as a burnt offering and sweet-smelling incense.



He is the Captain of our salvation whom the Father has given us to bring many sons to glory, and in whose footsteps we seek to walk.



The Lamb on the Throne is my Advocate with the Father, who liveth to intercede for me. The Lamb on the Throne has power to lead me and fashion me according to His own image. The Lamb on the throne of my heart, willing and able to increase His own meekness and self-sacrifice within me, and His love to the Father and His redeemed ones. "These are they which have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb." "The Lamb which is in the midst of the Throne shall be their Shepherd, and shall guide them to fountains of waters of life" (Rev. vii. 17).



Follow the Lamb! Let this be our watchword and prayer each day! The Lamb who was slain for us is now in the fulness of His grace in the midst of the Throne, our chief Captain, and the Perfecter of our faith.
