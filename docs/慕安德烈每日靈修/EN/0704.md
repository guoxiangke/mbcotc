## TO HIM BE THE GLORY ##

Scripture: "Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and His Father; to Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen."—REV. i. 5, 6.



Some of my readers may feel that it is not easy to understand the lesson of the cross, or to carry it out in their lives. Do not think of it as a heavy burden or yoke that you have to bear. Christ says: "My yoke is easy, and My burden is light." Love makes everything easy. Do not think of your love to Him, but of His great love to you, given through the Holy Spirit. Meditate on this day and night, until you have the assurance: He loves me unspeakably. It is through the love of Christ on the cross that souls are drawn to Him.



We have here the answer as to what will enable us to love the fellowship of the crucified Jesus. Nothing less than His love poured out through the continual inspiration of the Holy Spirit into the heart of every child of God.



"Unto Him that loved us."—Be still, O my soul, and think what this everlasting love is that seeks to take possession of you and fill you with joy unspeakable.



"And washed us from our sins in His own blood."—Is that not proof enough that He will never reject me; that I am precious in His sight, and through the power of His blood am well-pleasing to God ?



"And hath made us kings and priests unto God and His Fa¬ther,"—and now preserves us by His power, and will strengthen us through His Spirit to reign as kings over sin and the world, and to appear as priests before God in intercession for others. O Christian, learn this wonderful song, and repeat it until your heart is filled with love and joy and courage, and turns to Him in glad surrender day by day.—"To Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen."



Yes, to Him, who has loved me, and washed me from my sins in His blood, and made me a king and a priest—to Him be the glory in all ages. Amen.
