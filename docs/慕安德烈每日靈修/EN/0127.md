## THE STRENGTH OF THE CHRISTIAN ##

Scripture: "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might."â€”EPH. vi. 10.



The Apostle has reached the end of his Epistle, and begins his last division with the words: "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord."

The Christian needs strength. This we all know. The Christian has no strength of his own. This is also true. Where may strength be obtained ? Notice the answer: "Be strong in the Lord and the power of His might."

Paul had spoken of this power in the earlier part of his Epistle (i. 17-19). He had prayed God to give them the Spirit that they might know the exceeding greatness of His power according to the working of His mighty power, which He wrought in Christ when He raised Him from the dead. This is the literal truth: the exceeding greatness of His power, which raised Christ from the dead, works in every believer. In me and in you, my reader. We hardly believe it, and still less do we experience it. That is why Paul prays, and we must pray with him, that God through His Spirit would teach us to believe in His almighty power. Pray with all your heart: Father, grant me the Spirit of wisdom, that I may experience this power in my life.

In chapter iii. 16, 17, Paul prays the Father to grant them, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man, that Christ might dwell in their hearts. And then: "Now unto Him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly, above all we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto Him be glory."

Read over these two passages again, and pray for God's Spirit to enlighten your eyes. Believe in the divine power work-mg within you. Pray that the Holy Spirit may reveal it to you, and appropriate the promise that God will manifest His power in your heart, supplying all your needs.

Do you not begin to realize that time is needed, much time in intercourse with the Father and the Son, if you would experience the power of God within you?
