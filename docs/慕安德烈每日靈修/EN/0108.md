## THE WORD AND PRAYER ##

Scripture: "Quicken me, 0 Lord, according to Thy Word."—PS. cxix. 107.



Prayer and the Word of God are inseparable, and should always go together in the quiet time of the inner chamber In His Word God speaks to me; in prayer I speak to God. If there is to be true intercourse, God and I must both take part. If I simply pray, without using God's Word, I am apt to use my own words and thoughts. This really gives prayer its power, that I take God's thoughts from His Word, and present them before Him. Then I am enabled to pray according to God's Word. How indispensable God's Word is for all true prayer！

When I pray, I must seek to know God aright. It is through the Word that the Holy Spirit gives me right thoughts of Him. The Word will also teach me how wretched and sinful I am. It reveals to me all the wonders that God will do for me, and the strength He will give me to do His will. The Word teaches me how to pray with strong desire, with a firm faith, and with con¬stant perseverance. The Word teaches me not only what I am, but what I may become through God's grace. And above all, it reminds me each day that Christ is the great Intercessor, and allows me to pray in His Name.

O Christian, learn this great lesson, to renew your strength each day in God's Word, and so pray according to His will.

Then we turn to the other side,—Prayer. We need prayer when we read God's Word,—prayer to be taught of God to understand His Word, prayer that through the Holy Spirit I may rightly know and use God's Word,—prayer that I may see in the Word that Christ is all in all, and will be all in me.

Blessed inner chamber, where I may approach God in Christ through the Word and prayer. There I may offer myself to God and His service, and be strengthened by the Holy Spirit, so that His love may be shed abroad in my heart and I may daily walk in that love.
