## THE SPIRIT AND THE BLOOD ##

Scripture: "There are three who bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one,"â€”1 JOHN v. 8.



The water is external, a sign of the renewing and purifying through regeneration used in baptism. The Spirit and the blood are two spiritual expressions, working together in regeneration: the blood for the forgiveness of sins, the Spirit for the renewal of the whole nature. All through life the Spirit and the blood must agree.



The oneness is spiritual and true. Through the blood we obtain the Spirit, as through the blood we are redeemed and purified unto it to receive the Spirit. Only through the blood can we with confidence pray for and receive the Spirit. O Christian, would you have boldness each day to trust to the guidance of the Spirit, then let your faith in the precious blood be sure and strong.



There may be some sin in your life of which you are hardly conscious, but which grieves the Spirit and drives Him away. The only way to avoid this is to believe that "the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses from all sin." Your only right to approach God is through the blood of the Lamb. Come with every sin, known or unknown, and plead the blood of Christ as your only claim on the love that accepts and forgives.



Nevertheless, do not rest content with the forgiveness of sins, but accept the fulness of the Spirit, to which the blood gives you access. In the Old Testament the priest went into the Holy Place with the blood, and the High Priest into the Holiest of All. With the blood Christ entered the heavenly sanctuary and poured out thence the Holy Spirit. Do not for a moment doubt that you have a right through the blood to the fulness of the Spirit.



As one who has been redeemed by the blood of Christ, make a complete surrender of yourself to God as His purchased possession, a vessel ready for Him to use, a dwelling-place of the Holy Spirit.
