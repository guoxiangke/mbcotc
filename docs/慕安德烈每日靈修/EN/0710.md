## CHRIST CRUCIFIED ##

Scripture: "God forbid that I should glory, save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world."—GAL. vi. 14.





Christ’s highest glory is His Cross. It was in this that He glorified the Father, and the Father glorified Him. It was as the Lamb slain in the midst of the throne that in that wonderful fifth chapter of Revelation He receives the worship of the ransomed and the angels and all creation. And it is as the Crucified One that His servants have learned to say: "God forbid that I should glory save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which I am crucified to the world." Is it not reasonable that Christ's highest glory should be our only glory too?



When the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, "Lo, I am with you alway," it was as the Crucified One, Who had shown them His hands and His feet, that He gave the promise. And to each one who seeks to claim the promise, it is of the first importance that he should realize: It is the crucified Jesus who promises, who offers, to be with me every day.



May not this be one reason why we find it so difficult to expect and enjoy the abiding presence?—because we do not glory in the Cross by which we are crucified to the world. We have been crucified with Christ; our "old man was crucified with Him"; "they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts,"—and yet how little we have learned that the world has been crucified to us, and that we are free from its power. How little we have learned, as those who are crucified with Christ, to deny ourselves, to have the mind that was in Christ, when He emptied Himself, and took the form of a servant, and humbled Himself and became obedient even to the death of the Cross.



Oh, let us learn the lesson, it is the crucified Christ who comes to walk with us every day, and in Whose power we too are to live the life that can say: "I have been crucified with Christ"; "Christ crucified lives in me."
