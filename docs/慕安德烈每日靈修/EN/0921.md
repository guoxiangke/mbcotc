## A SONG OF LOVE ##

Scripture: "But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love."—1 Cor. xiii. 13.



This chapter is wholly devoted to the praise of love. The first three verses speak of the absolute necessity of love, as the chief thing in our religion. "If I speak with the tongues of angels, if I have the gift of prophecy, if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, and if I bestow all my goods on the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love"; then, three times repeated, "I am become sounding brass, I am nothing, it profiteth me nothing." If I have not love, it all profiteth me nothing.



Then follows the Song of Love (vs. 4-8). There are fifteen things said about love—what it is and what it is not. In this description one sentence sums up the whole nature of love: "It seeketh not its own." And again: "Love never faileth." Proph¬ecies, tongues, and knowledge shall vanish away. Even faith and hope shall be changed into sight. But Love abides to all eternity, as long as God endures. Love is the greatest thing in the world.



We should read this chapter oftener than we do, and commit the Song to memory; so that the great words are imprinted on our hearts: "Love seeketh not her own." Think over it and pray over it. "Love never faileth." Consider all that means. "The greatest of these is love." Let this love rule in your life.



God is love. "He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him." O Christian, are you living in a world that is uncharitable and selfish, or full of bitterness and hatred? Take refuge under the wings of this everlasting love. Let your heart be filled with it, so that by God's almighty power you may be a witness to the transforming power of love. Thus you will be a fountain of blessing to all around you.



Live each day in fellowship with the triune love of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and you will learn the secret of how to love.
