## FAITH IN CHRIST ##

Scripture: "Ye believe in God, believe also in Ate."—JOHN xiv. 1.



In the Farewell Discourse (John xiv-xvii), when Christ was about to leave His disciples, He taught them that they were to believe in Him with the same perfect confidence which they had reposed in God. "Ye believe in God, believe also in Me." "Believe Me, that I am in the Father." "He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also." Here on earth He had not been able to make Himself fully known to His disciples. But in heaven the fulness of God's power would be His; and He would, in and through His disciples, do greater things than He had ever done upon earth. This faith must fix itself first of all on the person of Christ in His union with the Father. They were to have the perfect confidence that all that God had done could now be done by Jesus too. The deity of Christ is the rock on which our faith depends. Christ as man, partaker of our nature, is in very deed true God. As the Divine power has worked in Christ even to the resurrection from the dead, so Christ can also, in His Di¬vine omnipotence, work in us all that we need.



Dear Christians, do you not see of what deep importance it is that you take time to worship Jesus in His Divine Omnipotence as one with the Father ? That will teach you to count on Him in His sufficiency to work in us all that we can desire. This faith must so possess us that every thought of Christ will be filled with the consciousness of His presence as an Almighty Redeemer, able to save and sanctify and empower us to the very uttermost.



Child of God, bow in deep humility before this blessed Lord Jesus, and worship Him: my Lord and my God! Take time until you come under the full consciousness of an assured faith that as the Almighty God, Christ will work for you, and in you and through you, all that God desires and all that you can need. Let the Saviour you have known and loved become as never before the Mighty God. Let Him be your confidence and your strength.



The Saviour was about to leave the world. In His Farewell Charge on the last night He begins by telling them that everything would depend through their whole life on simply believing Him. By that they would even do greater things than He had ever done. And at the close of His address He repeats again: "Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world." Our one need is a direct, definite, unceasing faith in the mighty power of Christ working in us.
