## "LOVE YOUR ENEMIES." "ME NO' LOVE FINGO." ##

Scripture: "Ye have heard that it hath been said: Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy."—MATT. v. 43.



It was the Jewish Rabbis in Christ's earthly day who said this. They deemed they had a right to say it because of what was written in Lev. xix. 17, 18: "Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart; thou shalt not bear any grudge against the children of thy people; but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." From this they argued that it was only the children of their own people whom they might not hate; it was all right to hate their enemies. But our Lord said: "Love your enemies: bless them that curse you."



How often the Christian follows the example of the Jewish teachers! The command of our Lord is too strict and narrow for him; he has not yielded himself to God in obedience to the new commandment to love his brethren with Christ's love, believing that this love will flow out to all around, even to those who hate us. This will require much grace, and will cost time and trouble, and much earnest prayer.



When I was a minister in Cape Town, I met a German deaconess, who was working in connection with the English Church at Woodstock. She had a class every evening for ten or twelve Kaffirs, who were preparing for admission to the Church. One evening she spoke about loving our enemies. She asked one man if his people had enemies. "Oh, yes!" "Who were they ?" "The Fingoes." (The Kaffirs count the Fingoes as dogs.) She asked the man if he could love a Fingo. His answer was quite decided: "Me no' love Fingo. Me no' love Fingo." It was an indisputable fact; there could be no question about it. He could not love a Fingo. She told him that in that case he could not go to the Com¬munion. He went home very thoughtful, and the next evening at class seemed very downcast. But he still had only one answer: "Me no' love Fingo." He was not received into the church with the others, but continued to attend the class. He was always in earnest, and there was evidently a struggle going on; until one evening he appeared with a bright face, and said: "Me now love Fingo." He had prayed about it, and God had heard his prayer. There is only one way to love our enemies: by the love of Christ, sought and found in prayer.
