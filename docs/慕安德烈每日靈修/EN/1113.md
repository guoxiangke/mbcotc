## CHRIST AND THE SPIRIT ##

Scripture: "He that believeth on Me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. This spake He of the Spirit, which they that believed on Him were to receive."â€”JOHN vii. 38, 39.



Each Person of the blessed Trinity gives honor to the Other. The Father seeks the honor of the Son and the Son seeks the honor of the Spirit, and the Spirit honors the Son. So in our text we hear Christ calling us to believe in Him, confident that the Holy Spirit will work powerfully in us according to the measure of our faith in Christ. On the other hand Christ says, "The Spirit shall not speak from Himself; but what things soever He shall hear, these shall He speak. He shall glorify Me: for He shall take of Mine, and shall declare it unto you" (John xvi. 13,14).



Here we learn the important lesson that we must not expect the Holy Spirit always to give us tokens of His Presence. He will ever seek to fix our attention upon Christ. The surest way to be filled with the Spirit is whole-heartedly to occupy ourselves by faith with Christ. We may rely upon the Holy Spirit to enable us to do this.



Begin every morning in God's Presence, and there commit yourself to Christ to accomplish His work in you. Thank the Father for the gift of the Holy Spirit, who enables you to abide in the love and the obedience of the Lord Jesus. Believe firmly that the Triune God works in your heart and has His hidden heaven there, which will be revealed to you as your heart is wholly given to His Son and Spirit. "Through Christ we have access to the Father through the Spirit."



Learn this important lesson. The stronger your faith in Christ the more freely will the Spirit flow from you. The more you believe in the ever-abiding Spirit the more surely you will know that Christ dwells and works within.
