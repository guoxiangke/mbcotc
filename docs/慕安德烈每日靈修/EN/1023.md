## THE SPIRIT PROMISED TO THE OBEDIENT ##

Scripture: "If ye love Me, ye will keep My commandments. And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter."— JOHN xiv. 15, 16.



Christ would ascend to heaven, and pray the Father to send the Comforter, the Holy Spirit. He would not only do this once, but it would form part of His intercessory work. He would remain "ever living to make intercession." The continual communication of the Spirit of the Father comes through the Son.



The Lord tells us here on what conditions He will send the Spirit. If we love Him and keep His commandments: "I will pray the Father." This is a word of deep meaning, a searching word—a word of greatly needed and blessed teaching. The Holy Spirit is given us to enable us to do the will of the Father. The condition is reasonable and just, that as far as we have kept the commandments through the Spirit, the Spirit will be granted to us in fuller measure. As we heartily accept this truth, and yield ourselves willingly to the Spirit's guidance, we shall receive from day to day the fulness of the Spirit. Let us say to God that we accept the condition with all our heart, and will strive to keep His commands, and ask for power to do His commandments more perfectly.



Do not listen to the whispers of Satan, or give way to unbe¬lief and sloth. Surrender yourself unreservedly to the Lord, who has said: "If ye love me, ye will keep my commands." Love will enable you to do it. The Lord Jesus does not deceive us with a vain hope in this matter. No, He gives the grace, He gives His own love in our hearts, teaching us to say: "I delight to do Thy will." Let us trust Him with childlike faith, and give ourselves wholly—that is all that is necessary—to do His will. Then the beauty of the divine agreement that He makes with us will dawn upon us: "If ye keep My commandments ye shall abide in My love," and the Father will send the Holy Spirit anew each day.
