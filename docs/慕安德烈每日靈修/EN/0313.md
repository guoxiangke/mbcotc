## GOD THE FATHER ##

Scripture: "Baptising in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and' of the Holy Ghost."â€”MATT, xxviii. 19.



It is well we should remember that the doctrine of the Holy Trinity has a deep devotional aspect. As we think of God we remember the inconceivable distance that separates Him in His holiness from sinful men, and we bow in deep contrition and holy fear. As we think of Christ the Son, we remember the inconceivable nearness in which He came to be born of a woman, a daughter of Adam, and to die the accursed death, and so to be inseparably joined to us to all eternity. And as we think of the Holy Spirit we remember the inconceivable blessedness of God having His abode in us, and making us His home and His temple through eternity.

When Christ taught us to say, "Our Father, which art in heaven," He immediately added, "Hallowed be Thy Name." As God is holy, so we are to be holy too. And there is no way of becoming holy but by counting that name most holy, and drawing nigh to Him in prayer.

How often we speak that name without any sense of the unspeakable privilege of our relation to God. If we would just take time to come into contact with God and to worship Him in His Father love, how the inner chamber would become to us the gate of heaven.

Child of God, if you pray to your Father in secret, bow very low before Him, and seek to adore His name as most holy. Remember that this is the highest blessedness of prayer.

"Pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly" (Matt. vi. 6).

What an unspeakable privilege, to be alone with God in secret, and say, "My Father." To have the assurance that He has indeed seen me in secret, and will reward me openly. Take time until you can say:

"I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved" (Gen. xxxii. 30).
