## PUT ON CHRIST ##

Scripture: "As many of us as have been baptized with Christ, have put on Christ."â€”GAL. iii. 27.



The word that is here translated "put on," is the same that is used in regard to putting on clothes. We have put on "the new man," and we have the new nature as a garment that is worn, by means of which all can see who we are. Paul says of the Christian when he has confessed Christ at baptism, that he has put on Christ. As a man may be recognized by the garment he wears, so the Christian is known as one who has put on Christ, and exhibits Him in his whole life and character.

And again he says: "Put on the Lord Jesus." Not alone at conversion, but from day to day. As I put on my clothes each day and am seen in them, so the Christian must daily put on the Lord Jesus, so that he no longer lives after the flesh to fulfil its lusts, but shows forth the image of his Lord, and the new man formed in His likeness.

Put on Christ! This work must be done each day in the inner chamber. I must put on the Lord, the heavenly Jesus. But I need time to put on Christ. As my garments cover me and protect me from wind and sun, even so Christ Jesus will be my beauty, my defence, and my joy. As I commune with Him in prayer, He imparts Himself to me, and strengthens me to walk as one who is in Him, and bound to Him for ever.

O soul, take time to meditate on this wonderful truth. Just as your clothing is a necessity as you go out into the world, let it be equally indispensable for you to put on Jesus Christ to abide in Him and walk with Him all the day.

You feel that this cannot be done hastily and superficially. It takes time, quiet time in living fellowship with Jesus, to realize that you have put Him on. Take the time and the trouble. Your reward will be great.
