## NOT SINNING ##

Scripture: "Ye know that He was manifested to take away sins; and in Him is no sin. Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not."â€”1 JOHN in. 5, 6.



John had taken deep into his heart and life the words that Christ had spoken in the last night, on abiding in Him. He ever remembered how the Lord had six times over spoken of loving Him and keeping His commandments as the way to abiding in His love, and receiving the indwelling of the Father and the Son. And so in this Epistle in his old age the abiding in Christ is one of the key-words of the life it promises (John ii. 6, 24, 28; iii. 6, 24; iv. 13, 16).



In our text John teaches how we can be kept from sinning: "He that abideth in Christ sinneth not." Though there be sin in our nature, the abiding in Christ, in Whom is no sin, does indeed free us from the power of sin and enables us day by day to live so as to please God. Of the Lord Jesus it is written that He had said of the Father (John viii. 29) : "I do always those things that please Him." And so John writes in the Epistle: "Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness toward God; and whatsoever vfe ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight."



Let the soul that longs to be free from the power of sin take these simple but far-reaching words; "In Him is no sin," and "of God I am in Him." "He that establisheth us in Christ is God." As I seek to abide in Him in Whom there is no sin, Christ will indeed live out His own life in me in the power of the Holy Spirit, and fit me for a life in which I always do the things that are pleasing in His sight.



Dear child of God, you are called to a life in which faith, great faith, strong faith, continuous and unbroken faith, in the Almighty power of God is your one hope. As you day by day take time and yield yourself to the God of peace, Who perfects you in every good work to do His will, you will experience that what the heart has not conceived is what God indeed works in them that wait for Him.



"He that abideth in Him, sinneth not." The promise is sure: God the Almighty is pledged that He will work in you what is well-pleasing in His sight, through Christ Jesus. In that faith, abide in Him.



"Whosoever abideth in Him, sinneth not."



"Have I not said unto thee that, if thou believest, thou shalt see the glory of God?"
