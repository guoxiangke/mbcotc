## CHRIST AS INTERCESSOR ##

Scripture: "He is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them."— HEB. vii. 25.



When God had said in Isaiah that He wondered that there was no intercessor, there followed the words: "Therefore His arm brought salvation unto Him. The Redeemer shall come to Sion" (Isaiah lix. 16, 20). God Himself would provide the true intercessor, in Christ His Son, of whom it had already been said: "He bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors" (Isaiah liii. 12).

In His life on earth Christ began His work as Intercessor. Think of the high-priestly prayer on behalf of His disciples and of all who should through them believe in His Name. Think of His words to Peter, "I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not"—a proof of how intensely personal His intercession is. And on the Cross He spake as intercessor: "Father, forgive them." Now that He is seated at God's right hand, He continues, as our great High Priest, the work of intercession without ceasing. But with this difference, that He gives His people power to take part in it. Seven times in His farewell discourse He repeated the assurance that what they asked He would do.

The power of heaven was to be at their disposal. The grace and power of God waited for man's bidding. Through the leading of the Holy Spirit they would know what the will of God was. They would learn in faith to pray in His Name. He would present their petition to the Father, and through His and their united intercession the Church would be clothed with the power of the Spirit.

Blessed Redeemer, what wonderful grace that Thou callest us to share in Thy intercession! We pray Thee, arouse in Thy redeemed people a consciousness of the glory of this their calling, and of all the richt blessing which Thy Church in its impotence can, through its intercession in Thy Name, bring down upon this earth. May Thy Holy Spirit work in Thy people a deep conviction of the sin of restraining prayer, of the sloth and unbelief and selfishness that is the cause of it, and of Thy loving desire to pour out the Spirit of prayer in answer to their petitions —for Thy name's sake. AMEN.
