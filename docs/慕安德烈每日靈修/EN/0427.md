## THE EXCEEDING GREATNESS OF HIS POWER ##

Scripture: "I cease not to make mention of you in my prayers; that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation; having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that ye may know what is the exceeding great¬ness of His power to us-ward -who believe, according to that work¬ing of the strength of His might which He wrought in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead."—EPH. i. 16-20. R. V.



Here we have again one of the great texts in regard to which faith has to be exercised—words that will make our faith large and strong and bold. Paul is writing to men who had been sealed with the Holy Spirit. And yet he felt the need of unceasing prayer for the enlightening of the Spirit, that they might know in truth what the mighty power of God was that was working in them. It was nothing less than the very same power, the working of the strength of His might, by which He raised Christ from the dead.



Christ died on the tree under the weight of the sin of the world and its curse. When He descended into the grave it was under the weight of all that sin, and the power of that death which had apparently mastered Him. What a mighty working of the power of God, to raise that Man out of the grave to the power and the glory of His throne. And now it is that very same power, in the exceeding greatness of it toward us who believe that, by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, we are to know as working in us every day of our life. The Lord Who said to Abraham, "I am God Almighty, nothing is too hard for Me," comes to us with the message that what He did, not only in Abraham, but in Christ Jesus, is the pledge of what He is doing every moment in our hearts and will do effectually, if we learn to trust Him.



It is by that Almighty power that the risen and exalted Christ can be revealed in our hearts, as our life and our strength. How little believers believe this! Oh, let us cry to God, let us trust God for His Holy Spirit to enable us to claim nothing less every day than the exceeding greatness of this resurrection power working in us.



And let us very specially pray for all believers around us and throughout the Church that they may have their eyes opened to the wonderful vision of God's Almighty resurrection power working in them. And let ministers, like Paul, make this a matter of continual intercession for those among whom they labour. What a difference it would make in their ministry, the unceasing prayer for the Spirit to reveal the power that dwells and works in them.
