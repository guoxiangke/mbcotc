## THE DISCIPLES: THEIR DIVINE MISSION ##

Scripture: "The same day at evening . . . when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you."â€”JOHN xx. 19.



The disciples had received the message of Mary. Peter had told them that he had seen the Lord. Late in the evening the men from Emmaus told how he Had been made known to them. Their hearts were prepared for what now came, when Jesus stood in the midst of them and said, "Peace be unto you," and showed them His hands and His feet. This was not only to be a sign of recognition, but the deep eternal mystery of what would be seen in heaven when He was in the midst of the throne, "a Lamb as it had been slain."



"Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord." And He spoke again: "Peace be unto you! As the Father sent Me, so send I you." With Mary He revealed Himself to the fervent love that could not rest without Him. With the men at Emmaus it was their constraining prayer that received the revelation. Here He meets the willing servants whom He had trained for His service, and hands over to them the work He had done on earth. He changes their fear into the boldness of peace and gladness. He ascends to the Father; the work the Father had given Him to do He now entrusts to them. The Divine Mission is now theirs to make known and carry out to victory.



For this divine work they need nothing less than divine power. He breathes upon them the resurrection life He had won by His death. He fulfills the promise He gave: "I live, and ye shall live also." The exceeding greatness of the mighty power of God by which He raised Christ from the dead, none other than that spirit of holiness by which He, as the Son of God, was raised from the dead, will henceforth work in them. And all that was bound or loosed in that power would be bound in heaven.



The story comes to every messenger of the Gospel with wonderful power. To us too the word is spoken: "As the Father sent Me, so send I you." For us too is the word: "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." For us too the personal manifestation of Jesus as the Living One, with the pierced hands and feet. If our hearts are set on nothing less than the presence of the living Lord, we may count confidently it will be given us. Jesus never sends His servants out without the promise of His abiding presence and His almighty power.
