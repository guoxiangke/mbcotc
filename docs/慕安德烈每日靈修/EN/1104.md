## THE SPIRIT FROM HEAVEN ##

Scripture: "Them that preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven."—1 PET. i .12.



Christ has taught us to think of God as our own Father in heaven, who is ready to bestow His blessings on His children on earth. Our Lord Himself was taken up into the glory of heaven, and we are told that we are seated with Him in the heavenly places in Christ. The Holy Spirit comes to us from heaven to pour into our hearts all the light, and the love, and the joy, and the power of heaven.



Those who are truly filled with the Spirit have a heavenly life in themselves. Their walk and conversation are in heaven. They are in daily fellowship with the Father and with the Son. They seek the things that are above, for their life is hid with Christ in God. Their chief characteristic is heavenly-mindedness. They carry about with them the marks of their eternal, heavenly destiny.



How can one cultivate this heavenly disposition ? By allowing the Holy Spirit, sent from heaven, to do His heavenly work in our hearts, and to bring to ripeness in our souls the fruits of the Spirit which grow in the Paradise of God. The Spirit will raise our hearts daily to fellowship with God in heaven, and will teach us to dwell in the heavenlies with Him. The Spirit makes the glorified Christ in heaven present in our hearts, and teaches us to dwell in His abiding presence.



O Christian, take time each day to receive from the Father the continual guidance of the Holy Spirit. Let Him overcome the world for you, and strengthen you as a child of heaven to walk daily with your God and with the Lord Jesus. Do not be unbe¬lieving. The Holy Spirit will do His part, if you in faith sur¬render yourself to His control. You will learn to speak to others with such heavenly joy that you will draw them, too, to give ; themselves to the leading of the Spirit, and to walk in the heavenly joy of Christ's love.
