## HALF AN HOUR SILENCE IN HEAVEN ##

Scripture: "And there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. And another angel came and stood at the altar; and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar. And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God."—REV. viii 1, 3, 4.



There was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour —to bring the prayers of the saints before God, before the first angel souded his trumpet. And so ten thousands of God's children have felt the absolute need of silence and retire¬ment from the things of earth for half an hour, to present their prayers before God, and in fellowship with Him be strengthened for their daily work.

How often the complaint is heard that there is no time for prayer. And often the confession is made that, even if time could be found, one feels unable to spend the time in real intercourse with God. No one needs ask what it is that hinders growth in the spiritual life. The secret of strength can only be found in living intercourse with God.

O my brother, if you would only obey Christ when He says: "When thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret," and have the courage to be alone with God for half an hour. Do not think, I will not know how to spend the time. Just believe, that if you begin and are faithful, and bow in silence be¬fore God, He will reveal Himself to you.

If you need help, read some passage of Scripture, and let God's Word speak to you. Then bow in deepest humility before God, and wait on Him. He will work within you. Read Ps. Ixi., Ixii., or Ixiii., and speak the words out before God. Then begin to pray. Intercede for your own household and children, for the congregation, for the Church and minister, for schools and missions. Keep on, though the time may seem long. God will reward you. But above all, be sure you meet God.

Brother, God longs to bless you. Is it not worth the trouble to take half an hour alone with God? In heaven itself there was need for half an hour's silence to present the prayers of the saints before God. If you persevere, you may find that the half-hour that seems the most difficult in the whole day may at length become the most blessed in your whole life.

"My soul is silent unto God."

"My soul, be thou silent unto God; for my expectation is from Him" (Ps. Ixii. 1, 5).
