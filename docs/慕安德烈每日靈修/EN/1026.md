## THE SPIRIT OF SANCTIFICATION ##

Scripture: "Elect, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Christ."—1 PET. i. 2.



In the Old Testament God was revealed as the Thrice Holy One. The Spirit is mentioned more than a hundred times, but only three times as the Holy Spirit. But in the New Testament the word Holy is ascribed to the Holy Spirit, and Christ sanctified Himself for us, that we might be holy. The great work of the Holy Spirit is to glorify Christ in us as our Sanctification.



Has this truth ever taken hold of you—at the Pentecostal prayer-meetings or in your private devotions—that the great object for which the Holy Spirit is given is to sanctify you? If you do not accept this truth, then the Holy Spirit cannot do His purifying work. If you only want the Spirit to help you to be a little better, and to pray a little more, you will not get very far. But when you once understand that He has the name of Holy Spirit in order definitely to impart God's holiness, and will sanctify you wholly, then you will begin to realize that the Holy Spirit dwells in your heart.



And what will be the result ? You will feel that He must have you wholly. He must rule and control the whole day. My whole life and conversation must be in the Spirit. My prayer, my faith, my fellowship with the Father, and all my work in God's service, must be completely under His sway. As the Spirit of holiness, He is the Spirit of my sanctification.



Dear brother, what I have just said is deep, eternal truth. Even if we are willing to accept this truth, and meditate on it daily, it will be of no avail if we do not wait upon God to grant us the Spirit of heavenly wisdom, and a vision of what God has intended for us in His wonderful gift—the Spirit of sanctification. Each morning say slowly and calmly: "Abba, Father, for this new day renew within me the gift of Thy Holy Spirit."
