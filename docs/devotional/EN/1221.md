## THE HEAVENLY LIFE ##

Scripture: "The Throne of God and of the Lamb shall be therein: and His servants shall do Him service; and they shall see His face; and His name shall be on their foreheads."—REV. xxii. 3, 4.



Many Christians seek the Throne of Grace that they may find grace sufficient for their need, but they do not tarry until the grace from the Throne of God and of the Lamb fills their entire life, and enables them to walk night and day in its light, and experience the full impress of its glory.



To those who have faith in the unseen life, and know that they have come to the heavenly Jerusalem, and the blood of sprinkling (Heb. xii. 22-24)—to them the promises in our text are fulfilled. The earthly life becomes an actual experience of prepara¬tion for the heavenly life.



"His servants shall do Him service"; at first without the sight of His glory. The faithful soul finds a reward and goes a step farther, "They shall see His face." It becomes possible to walk in the light of His countenance, and to rejoice in Him the whole day. The Omnipresent One is the Almighty One, and His presence abides with His servant.



There is a further promise—"His Name shall be on their foreheads." Obedience to God's commandments, the abiding in the light of His countenance, has an influence on the character and even the appearance of the children of God. As the fruit and reward of seeking to do all in the Name of Jesus (Col. iii. 17), the likeness to His image is seen in them, and His Name is visible on their foreheads.



Dear Christian, it is a great thing to approach the Throne of Grace and to receive grace for each day. But there is a still greater blessing when the face of God and of the Lamb are revealed to our earnest gaze, and we walk each day in their light. When the Name of Christ is engraved upon our hearts and upon our foreheads, then we are changed into His image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.



God grant that we may all know the Throne of Grace in its holy and sanctifying influence! "His servants shall do Him ser¬vice; and they shall see His face; and His Name shall be on their foreheads."
