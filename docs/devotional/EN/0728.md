## THE MISSIONARY'S LIFE ##

Scripture: "Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and righteously and unblameably we behaved ourselves toward you that believe." —1 THESS. ii. 10. R. V.



Paul more than once appeals to what his converts had seen of his own life. So he says (2 Cor. i. 12): "Our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward." Christ had taught His disciples as much of His life as by His teaching. Paul had sought to be a living witness to the truth of all that he had preached about Christ—as able to save and to keep from sin, as renewing the whole nature by the power of His Holy Spirit, as Himself becoming the life of those who believe in Him.



In the W. M. C. Report (vol. v. p. 218) one finds this expression : "It has come to pass that our representatives on the field, just because they are what we have made them, have far too often hidden the Christ Whom they are giving their lives to reveal. It is only in proportion as the missionary can manifest the character of Christ in and through his own life that he can gain a hearing for the Gospel. Only as far as he can live Christ before their eyes can he help them to understand his message."



See how Paul's appeal to his life, as holy and righteous and unblameable, gave him courage to put a high standard before his converts. In the same Epistle he calls them to trust God, to establish their hearts unblameable in holiness before God (I Thess. iii. 13). And later in the Epistle (v. 23, 24) : "The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, Who also will do it." In Phil. iv. 9 he writes: "The things which ye both heard and saw in me, these things do, and the God of peace shall be with you." And in I Tim. i. 14-16: "The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus, . . . for an ensample of them which should hereafter believe on Him unto eternal life." Let us believe that when Paul said, "Christ liveth in me," "I live no more," he spoke of an actual, divine, unceasing, abiding of Christ in him, working in him from hour to hour all that was well-pleasing to the Father. And let us not rest until we can say, "The Christ of Paul is my Christ! His missionary enduement is mine too."
