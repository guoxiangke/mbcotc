## THE REIGN OF GRACE ##

Scripture: "They that receive the abundance of grace shall reign in life through Jesus Christ."—ROM. v. 17.



Let us once more think what the Throne of Grace can be to us. The grace that reigns through Jesus Christ enables us to gain the victory over sin in our life here below.



Salvation does not, as many think, mean a life of falling and rising again. No, it is God's will that His children should be con¬querors in their life here upon earth. But on one condition—that they should day by day live in the abundance of grace that is to be obtained at the Throne of Grace. Let us read again the words in which the reign of grace is revealed to us. In the verses which follow on our text this point is made clear (Rom. v. 20, 21). "The law came in beside, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did abound more exceedingly." Is it not won¬derful, that although sin abounds, grace is always greater and more abundant than sin can ever be. I may, by reading God's Word, have an overpowering sense of the great power of sin, but I have also the assurance that grace, as the life-power of God within me, is far more abundant and powerful.



Then these words follow: "As sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Whatever I may know or feel of the power of sin in the world, or in myself, I know too that grace is stronger, grace always has the victory over sin—"We are more than conquerors through Him that loved us." This is a sure word. They that receive the abundance of grace reign already in this life through Jesus Christ.



Do you not see how everything depends on appearing daily before the Throne of Grace with a deep sense of need, but fully assured that abundant grace, as the power to conquer sin, will be given us ? Oh, that God's children would realize that the footstool of the Throne of Grace is the place where each one may experience that "God is able to make all grace abound unto us, that we, always having all sufficiency in everything, may abound unto every good work!"
