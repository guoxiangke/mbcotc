## WITHOUT THE GATE ##

Scripture: "The bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the Holy Place, are burned without the camp. Wherefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered without the gate. Let us go forth therefore unto Him without the camp, bearing His reproach."â€”HEB. xiii. 11-13



The blood of the sin offering was brought into the Holy Place; the body of the sacrifice was burnt without the camp. Even so with Christ, His blood was presented to the Father; but His body was cast out as an accursed thing, without the camp.



And so we read in Hebrews x.: "Let us enter into the Holy Place by the blood of Jesus." And in our text: "Let us go forth unto Him without the camp, bearing His reproach." The deeper my insight is into the boldness which His blood gives me in God's presence, so much greater will be the joy with which I enter the Holy Place. And the deeper my insight is into the shame of the cross which He on my behalf bore without the camp, the more willing shall I be, in the fellowship of His cross, to follow Him without the camp, bearing His reproach.



There are many Christians who love to hear of the boldness with which we can enter into the Holy Place through His blood, who yet have little desire for the fellowship of His reproach, and are unwilling to separate themselves from the world with the same boldness with which they think to enter the sanctuary. The Christian suffers inconceivable loss when he thinks of entering into the Holy Place in faith and prayer, and then feels himself free to enjoy the friendship of the world, so long as he does nothing actually sinful. But the Word of God has said: "Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity against God?" "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world; if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him." "Be not conformed to this world."



To be a follower of Christ implies a heart given up to testify for Christ in the midst of the world, if by any means some may be won. To be a follower of Christ means to be like Him in His love of the cross, and His will to sacrifice self that the Father may be glorified, and that men may be saved.



Blessed Saviour, teach me what it means that I am called to follow Thee without the camp, bearing Thy reproach, and so to bear witness to Thy holy redeeming love, as it embraces the men who are in the world to win them back to the Father. Blessed Lord, let the spirit and the love that was in Thee be in me too, that I may at any cost seek to win the souls for whom Thou hast died.
