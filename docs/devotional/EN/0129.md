## IN CHRIST ##

Scripture: "Of God are ye in Christ Jesus."— 1 COR. i. 30.



The expression "in Christ" is often used in the Epistles. The Christian cannot read God's Word aright, nor experience its full power in his life, until he prayerfully and believingly accepts this truth: I am in Christ Jesus.

The Lord Jesus in the last night with His disciples used this word more than once. "In that day,"—when the Spirit had been poured out, "ye shall know that I am in the Father, and ye in Me." And then follows "Abide in Me; he that abideth in Me beareth much fruit." "If ye abide in Me, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you." But the Christian cannot appropriate these promises unless he first prayerfully accepts the word: in Christ.

Paul expresses the same thought in Romans. "We are buried with Christ." "We are dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord." "There is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus." And in Ephesians: "God has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Christ;" hath chosen us in Him; hath made us accepted in the Beloved; in Him we have redemption. And in Colossians: "In Him dwelleth all the fulness"; we are "perfect in Christ Jesus." "Walk ye in Him." "Ye are complete in Him."

Let our faith take hold of the words: "It is God that stablisheth us in Christ." "Of God I am in Christ Jesus." The Holy Spirit will make it our experience. Pray earnestly and follow the leading of the Spirit. The word will take root in your heart, and you will realize something of its heavenly power. But remember that abiding in Christ is a matter of the heart. It must be cultivated in a spirit of love. Only as we take time from day to day in fellowship with Christ will the abiding in Christ become a blessed reality, and the inner man will be renewed from day to day.
