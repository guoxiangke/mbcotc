## STEWARDS OF THE LOVE OF GOD ##

Scripture: "Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful."â€”1 COR. iv. 1, 2.



A Steward is the man to whom the king or master entrusts his treasures and goods, to apportion to those who have a right to them. God in heaven needs men on earth to make known the treasures of His love, and to give them to those who have need. The minister of the Gospel is a steward of the mystery of God, and above all of the deep mystery of His everlasting love, and all the blessings that flow from it.



It is required in stewards that a man be found faithful; he must devote himself wholly to his life task. He must be faithful at his work, and always at his post in the palace or house where the treasures are stored up. So the minister of the Gospel must himself be faithful, living each day in the love and fellowship of God. He must be faithful not only to God, but to his fellow-men, caring for the needs of the souls entrusted to him, and ready to recommend God's love, and to share it with others. This divine love is a mystery, and can only dwell in a heart set apart for God and satisfied with His love, which flows from Him as a stream of living water.



O child of God, seek to have a deeper insight into what the office of a servant of God means, as a steward of the wonderful love of God to sinners. Pray much and often for your ministers that God may hide them in the secret of His tabernacle, so that they may be faithful stewards of the mystery of God, and chiefly of the mystery of Divine Love.



And you, my beloved brethren, to whom the love of God in heaven, and of Christ on the cross, is entrusted, remember that your congregation, your Church, and your people are dependent on your faithfulness in living a heavenly life in fellowship with God. Then you will be able with joy, and in the power of the Holy Ghost, to pass on the love of God to souls that so greatly need it.
