## GOD THE HOLY SPIRIT ##

Scripture: "Through Him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father."—EPH. ii. 18.



In our communion with God in the inner chamber, we must guard against the danger of seeking to know God and Christ in the power of the intellect or the emotions. The Holy Spirit has been given for the express purpose that "by Him we may have access to the Father through the Son." Let us beware lest our labour be in vain, because we do not wait for the teaching of the Spirit.

Christ taught His disciples this truth in the last night. Speaking of the coming of the Comforter, He says: "In that day ye shall ask the Father in My name; ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full." Hold fast the truth that the Holy Spirit was given with the one great object of teaching us to pray. He makes the fellowship with the Father and the Son a blessed reality. Be strong in the faith that He is working secretly in you As you enter the inner chamber, give yourself wholly to His guidance as your Teacher in all your intercession and adoration.

When Christ said to the disciples on the evening of the resur¬rection day, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost," it was, for one thing, to strengthen and fit them for the ten days of prayer, and their receiving the fulness of the Spirit. This suggests to us three things we ought to remember when we draw nigh to God in prayer:

First.—We must pray in the confidence that the Holy Spirit dwells in us, and yield ourselves, in stillness of soul, definitely to His leading. Take time for this.

Second.—We must believe that the "greater works" of the Spirit for the enlightening and strengthening of the spiritual life —the fulness of the Spirit—will be given in answer to prayer.

Third.—We must believe that through the Spirit, in unity with all God's children, we may ask and expect the mighty work¬ings of that Spirit on His Church and people.

"He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water" (John vii. 38).

"Believest thou this?"
