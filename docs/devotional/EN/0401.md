## WAITING UPON GOD ##

Scripture: "On Thee do I wait all the day."—Ps. xxv. 5.



Waiting upon God—in this expression we find one of the deepest truths of God's Word in regard to the attitude of the soul in its intercourse with God.



Waiting upon God. Just think—that He may reveal Himself in us; that He may teach us all His will; that He may do to us what He has promised; that in all things He may be the Infinite God.



It is the attitude of soul with which each day should begin. On awaking in the morning, in the inner chamber, in quiet meditation, in the expression in prayer of our ardent longings and desires, in the course of our daily work, in all our striving after obedience and holiness, in all our struggles against sin and self-will—in everything there should be a waiting upon God to receive what He will bestow, to see what He will do, to allow Him to be the Almighty God.



Meditate on these things, and they will help you truly to value the precious promises of God's Word.



"They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles." There we have the secret of heavenly power and joy.



"Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and He shall strengthen thine heart; wait, I say, on the Lord."



"Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him."



The deep root of all Scriptural theology is this: Absolute dependence on God. As we exercise this spirit, it will become more natural and blessedly possible to say:



"On thee do I wait all the day."



There we have the secret of true, uninterrupted, silent adora¬tion and worship.

Has this book helped to teach us the true worship of God? If so, the Lord's name be praised.



Or have we only learned how little we know of it? For this, too, let us thank Him.



If we long for a fuller experience of this blessing, let us read the book again with a deeper insight as to what is meant, and the absolute need of a life in which the soul each day and all the day waits upon God. May the God of all grace grant this.



"I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in His word do I hope" (Ps. cxxx. 5).



"Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him, and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart" (Ps. xxxvii. 4, 7).
