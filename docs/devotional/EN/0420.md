## THE MYSTERY OF LOVE ##

Scripture: "I pray that they may all be one; even as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee; that they may be one, even as we are one; I in them, and Thou in Me."—JOHN xvii. 21-23.



In what Christ spoke in the last evening, He had specially pressed the thought of the disciples being in Him and abiding in Him. He had also mentioned His being in them, but had not given such prominence to this as the first thought, their being in Him. But in His prayer as High Priest, He gives larger place to the thought of His being in them, just as the Father was in Him. "That they may be one, even as we are one; I in them, and Thou in Me( that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that Thou didst send Me, and lovedst them, even as Thou lovedst Me."



The power to convince the world that God loved the disciples as He loved His Son, could only come as believers lived out their life of having Christ in them, and proving it by loving their brethren as Christ loved them. The feebleness of the Church is owing to this—that our life in Christ, and His life in us, is not known, and not proved to the world by the living unity in which our love manifests that Christ is in us. Nothing less than this is needed: such an indwelling of Christ in the heart, such a binding together of believers because they know and see and love each other as those who together have Christ dwelling in them. As we have it in the very last words of the prayer, "I have made known Thy name, that the love wherewith Thou lovest Me may be in them, and I in them." The Divine indwelling has its chief glory in that it is the manifestation of Divine love. The Father's love to Christ, brought by Christ to us, flowing out from us to the brethren, and to all men.



Christ had given (John xiv. 21, 23) the great promise to the loving, obedient disciple, "My Father will love him, and I will love him, and we will come and make our abode with him." It is to live this life of love to Christ and the brethren, that the Holy Spirit, in Whom the Father and the Son are one, longs to live in our heart. Let nothing less than this, child of God, be what you seek, what you believe, what you claim with your whole heart and strength—the indwelling of the Lord Jesus in the "love that passeth knowledge," with which He can fill your heart. So shall the world indeed be constrained by the love God's children bear to each other to acknowledge that the word is being fulfilled, "that the love wherewith Thou, Father, lovedst Me, may be in them, and I in them."



"Believest thou that I can do this?" "Yea, Lord."
