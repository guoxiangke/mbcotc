## THE OMNIPOTENCE OF GOD ##

Scripture: "I am the Almighty God."—GEN. xvii. 1.



When Abraham heard these words, he fell on his face; and God spake to him, and filled his heart with the faith in what God would do for him. O Christian, have you bowed in deep humility before God, until you felt that you were in living contact with the Almighty; until your heart has been filled with the faith that the Almighty God is working in you, and willl perfect His work in you?

Read in the Psalms how the saints of old gloried in God and in His strength.

"I will love Thee, O Lord, my strength" (Ps. xviii. 1).

"God is the strength of my heart" (Ps. Ixxiii. 26).

"The Lord is the strength of my life" (Ps. xxvii. 1).

"Thou strengthenedst me with strength in my soul" (Ps. cxxxviii. 3).

(See Ps. xviii. 32, xlvi. 1, Ixviii. 28, Ixviii. 35, lix. 17, Ixxxix. 17).

Take time to appropriate these words, and to adore God as the Almighty One, your strength.

Christ taught us that salvation is the work of God, and quite impossible to man. When the disciples asked, "Who then can be saved?" His answer was, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible." If we firmly believe this, we shall have courage to believe that God is working in us all that is well-pleasing in His sight.

Think how Paul prays for the Ephesians that through the enlightening of the Spirit they might know "the exceeding greatness of His power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of His mighty power." And (Col. i. 11) "Strength¬ened with all might, according to His glorious power." When a man fully believes that the mighty power of God is working without ceasing within him, he can joyfully say, "God is the strength of my life."

Do you wonder that many Christians complain of weakness and shortcomings? They do not understand that the Almighty God must work in them every hour of the day. That is the secret of the true life of faith.

Do not rest until you can say to God, "I will love Thee, O Lord, my strength." Let God have complete possession of you, and you will be able to say with all God's people, "Thou art the glory of their strength."
