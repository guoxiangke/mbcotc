## CHRIST IN ME ##

Scripture: "Know ye not…… how that Jesus Christ is in you?"— 2 COR. xiii. 5.



The Apostle would have each Christian live in the full assurance: Christ is in me. What a difference it would make in our lives if we could take time every morning to be filled with the thought: Christ is in me. As assuredly as I am in Christ, Christ is also in me.

In the last night Christ put it clearly to His disciples, that the Spirit would teach them: "In that day ye shall know that I am in the Father, and ye in Me, and I in you." First of all Ye in Me. Through the power of God all we who believe were crucified with Christ, and raised again with Him. And as a result: Christ is in us. But this knowledge does not come easily. Through faith in God's Word the Christian accepts it, and the Holy Spirit will lead us into all truth. Take time this very day to realize and appropriate this blessing in prayer.

How clearly Paul expresses the thought in the prayer of Ephesians iii. 16: "That the Father would grant you according to the riches of His glory." Notice that it is not the ordinary gift of grace, but a special revelation of the riches of His love and power. That he grant you to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith. Have you grasped it? The Christian may really have the experience of being filled with the fulness of God.

Dear Christian, Paul said: "I bow my knees unto the Father." That is the only way to obtain the blessing. Take time in the inner chamber to realize: Christ dwells in me. Too little have I experienced this in the past, but I will cry to God and wait upon Him to perfect His work in me. Even in the midst of my daily work, I must look upon my heart as the dwelling place of the Son of God, and say: "I am crucified with Christ, I live no more; Christ liveth in me." Thus only will Christ's words: "Abide in Me, and I in you," become my daily experience.
