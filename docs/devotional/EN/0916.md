## AS GOD FORGIVES ##

Scripture: "And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us."â€”LUKE xi. 4.



The forgiveness of sins is the great all-embracing gift by which, in His mercy, God sets the sinner free, and receives him back into His love and favor. The forgiveness of sins gives us boldness towards God, and is the source of our salvation. The forgiveness of sins gives us cause for thankfulness every day of our lives. It is God's will, and our souls feel the need of it, that we should each day walk with Him, as those whose sins are forgiven, and who are living in the light of His countenance.



As we walk with God in the full assurance of sins forgiven, He desires that, in our intercourse with our fellow-men, too, we should live as those who have been freely forgiven. And we can only prove our sincerity by forgiving those who have offended us, as freely and as willingly as God has forgiven us.



How clearly and urgently our Lord speaks upon this! In the Lord's Prayer we are taught to pray each day: "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors," and then at the end: "If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your trespasses" (Matt. vi. 15). After the great promise of Mark xi. 24, come the words: "And, whensoever ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any." In Matthew xviii. 21, we have the question of Peter: "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?" and our Lord's answer: "Unto seventy times seven." Then follows the parable of the servant whose Lord forgave him his debt, but who would not show compassion on his fellow-servant. His Lord's question to him was: "Shouldest not thou also have had mercy on thy fellow-servant, even as I had mercy on thee?" So he was delivered to his tormentors. And our Lord gives the warning: "So shall also My heavenly Father do unto you, if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts."



Let us remember to realize daily: As I need God's forgiveness each day, so let me be ready each day to forgive my brother. God grant us grace to do it!
