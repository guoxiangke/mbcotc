## GOD SEEKS INTERCESSORS ##

Scripture: "He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor." — ISAIAH lix. 16.



From of old God had among His people intercessors to whose voice He had listened and given deliverance. Here we read of a time of trouble when He sought for an intercessor, but in vain. And He wondered! Think of what that means — the amazement of God that there should be none who loved the people enough or who had sufficient faith in His power to deliver, to intercede, on their behalf. If there had been an intercessor He would have given deliverance; without an intercessor His judgments came down (see Isaiah Ixiv. 7; Ezek. xxii. 30, 31).

Of what infinite importance is the place the intercessor holds in the Kingdom of God! Is it not indeed a matter of wonder that God should give men such power, and yet that there are so few who know what it is to take hold of His strength and pray down His blessing on the world?

Let us try to realize the position. When God had in His Son wrought out the new creation, and Christ had taken His place on the Throne, the work of the extension of His Kingdom was given into the hands of men. He ever liveth to pray; prayer is the highest exercise of His royal prerogative as Priest-King upon the throne. All that Christ was to do in heaven was to be in fellowship with His people on earth. In His Divine condescension God has willed that the working of His Spirit shall follow the prayer of His people. He waits for their intercession, showing the preparation of heart — where and how much of His Spirit they are ready to receive.

God rules the world and His Church through the prayers of His people. "That God should have made the extension of His Kingdom to such a large extent dependent on the faithfulness of His people in prayer is a stupendous mystery and yet an absolute certainty." God calls for intercessors : in His grace He has made His work dependent on them ; He waits for them.

Our Father, open our eyes to see that Thou dost invite Thy children to have a part in the extension of Thy Kingdom by their faithfulness in prayer and intercession. Give us such OM insight into the glory of this holy calling, that with our whole heart we may yield ourselves to its blessed service. AMEN.
