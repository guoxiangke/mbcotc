## INTERCESSION ##

Scripture: "Praying at all seasons in the Spirit ... in all persever¬ance and supplication for all the saints."—EPH. vi. 18.



What an unspeakable blessing there is in intercession. That " one should pray down heavenly gifts on himself is a wonder of grace, but that he should bring down blessings on others is indeed an inconceivable honour. Will God indeed make the pouring out of blessing on others, dependent on our prayers? Yes, He makes us His remembrancers and fellow-workers. He has taken us into partnership in His work; if we fail in doing our part, others will suffer, and His work will suffer unspeakable loss.

God has appointed intercession as one of the means by which souls shall be saved, and saints and ministers of the Gospel edified and built up in the faith. Even the ends of the earth will receive life and blesssing through our prayers. Should we not expect God's children to strive joyfully and with all their powers, by means of intercession, to bring down blessing on the world ?

Christian, begin to use intercession as a means of grace for yourself and for others. Pray for your neighbors. Pray for souls with the definite desire that they may be won for Christ. Pray for your minister, for all ministers and missionaries. Pray for your country and people, for rulers and subjects. Pray for all men. If you surrender yourself to the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and live a life wholly for God, you will realize that the time spent in prayer is an offering well-pleasing to God, bringing blessing to yourself, and power into the lives of those for whom you pray.

Yes, "pray always with all prayer and supplication, watch¬ing thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints." And in so doing you will learn the lesson that intercession is the chief means of winning souls, and bringing glory to God.
