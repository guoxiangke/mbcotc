## EVERY DAY ##

Scripture: "Give us day by day our daily bread."—LUKE xi. 3.



There are some Christians who are afraid of the thoughts of a promise to pray every day as altogether beyond them.



They could not undertake it, and yet they pray to God to give them their bread day by day. Surely if a child of God has once yielded himself with his whole life to God's love and service, he should count it a privilege to avail himself of any invita¬tion that would help him every day to come into God's Presence with the great need of His Church and Kingdom.



Are there not many who confess that they desire to live wholly for God? They acknowledge that Christ gave Himself for them, and that His love now watches over them and works in them without ceasing. They admit the claim that nothing less than the measure of the love of Christ to us is to be the measure of our love to Him. They feel that if this is indeed to be the standard of their lives, they ought surely to welcome every opportunity for proving day by day that they are devoting their heart's strength to the interests of Christ's Kingdom and to the prayer that can bring down God's blessing.



Our invitation to daily united prayer may come to some as a new and perhaps unexpected opportunity of becoming God's remembrancers who cry day and night for His power and blessing on His people and on this needy world. Think of the privilege of being thus allowed to plead every day with God on behalf of His saints, for the outpouring of His Spirit, and for the coming of His Kingdom that His Will may indeed be done on earth as it is in Heaven. To those who have to confess that they have but little understood the high privilege and the solemn duty of waiting on God in prayer for His blessing on the world, the invita¬tion ought to be most welcome. And even to those who have already their special circles of work for which to pray, the thought that the enlargement of their vision, and their hearts, to include all God's saints and all the work of His Kingdom, and all the promise of an abundant outpouring of His Spirit, should urge them to take part in a ministry by which their other work will not suffer, but their hearts be strengthened with a joy and a love and a faith that they have never known before.
