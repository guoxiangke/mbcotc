## THE POWER OF PRAYER ##

Scripture: "The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth v. 16.



Prayer availeth much. It avails much with God. It avails much in the history of His Church and people. Prayer is the one great power which the Church can exercise in securing the working of God's omnipotence in the world.



The prayer of a righteous man availeth much. That is, a man who has the righteousness of Christ, not only as a garment covering him, but as a life-power inspiring him, as a new man "created in righteousness and true holiness (Eph. iv. 24). A man that lives as "the servant to righteousness" (Rom. vi. 16, 19). These are the righteous whom the Lord loveth and whose prayer hath power (Ps. Ixvi. 18, 19; 1 John iii. 22). When Christ gave His great prayer promises in the last night, it was to those who keep His commandments. "If ye love Me, ye will keep My commandments ; and I will pray the Father, and He will give you another -Comforter" (John xiv. 15, 16). "If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love; and ye shall ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you" (xv. 7, 10).



"The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much." It is only when the righteous man stirs up himself and rouses his whole being to take hold of God that the prayer availeth much. As Jacob said : "I will not let thee go ;" as the imporÂ¬tunate widow gave the just Judge no rest, so it is that the effectual fervent prayer effects great things.



And then comes the effectual fervent prayer of many righteous. When two or three agree, there is the promise of an answer. How much more when hundreds and thousands unite with one accord to cry to God to display His mighty power on behalf of His people.



Let us join those who have united themselves to call upon God for the mighty power of His Holy Spirit in His Church. What a great and blessed work, and what a sure prospect, in God's time, of an abundant answer ! Let us pray God individually and unitedly for the grace of the effectual fervent prayer which availeth much.
