## ABUNDANT GRACE ##

Scripture: "The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."—1 TIM. i. 14.



If we would value and love the Throne of Grace aright, we must try to understand what it is that it provides for our use. Scripture uses great words to reveal this grace to us. It speaks of "the riches of grace," "the glory of grace," "the abundance of grace," "the exceeding riches of grace," "the manifold riches of grace." Let these words sink deep into your hearts as we point to them in God's Word.



"Much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound unto the many" (Rom. v. 15). "Much more shall they that receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, even Jesus Christ" (v. 17). "Where sin abounded, grace did abound more exceedingly" (v. 20).



"By the grace of God, I am what I am: and His grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain \[powerless\] ; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me" (1 Cor. xv. 10). "God is able to make all grace abound unto you; that ye, always having all suf¬ficiency in all things, may abound to every good work" (2 Cor. ix. 8).



"To the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved: according to the riches of His grace" (Eph. i. 6, 7). "But God, being rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, quickened us together with Christ; that He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus" (Eph. ii. 4-7).



What treasures are contained in these words! Let the Holy Spirit write them in your heart, that you may receive the full impression of the "exceeding riches" and the abundance of the glory of the grace to be received at the Throne of Grace. Let the thought take possession of you that all day long the abundance of grace will be granted to the soul who approaches with boldness, and is ready to receive from the sympathizing High Priest that which He has to bestow.
