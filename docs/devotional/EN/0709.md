## CHRIST THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD ##

Scripture: This is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world."— JOHN iv. 42.



Omnipotence and Omnipresence are what are called natural attributes of God. They have their true worth only when linked to and inspired by His moral attributes, holiness and love. When our Lord spoke of the omnipotence having been given to Him—all power on earth and in heaven—and the omnipresence—His presence with each of His disciples—His words pointed to that which lies at the root of all—His divine glory as the Saviour of the world and Redeemer of men. It was because He humbled Himself and became obedient to death, the death of the Cross, that God so highly exalted Him. His share as the man Christ Jesus in the attributes of God was owing to the work He had done in His perfect obedience to the will of God and the finished redemption He had wrought out for the salvation of men.



It is this that gives meaning and worth to what He says of Himself as the omnipotent and omnipresent One. Between His mention of these two attributes, He gives His command that they should go out into all the world and preach the Gospel, and teach men to obey all that He has commanded. It is as the Redeemer Who saves and keeps from sin, as the Lord Christ Who claims obedience to all that He has commanded, that He promises His divine presence to be with His servants.



It follows as a matter of necessity that it is only when His servants in their lives show that they obey Him in all His commands, that they can expect the fullness of His power and His presence to be with them. It is only when they themselves are living witnesses to the reality of His power to save and to keep from sin that they can expect the full experience of His abiding presence, and that they will have power to train others to the life of obedience that He asks.



Yes, it is Jesus Christ Who saves His people from their sin, Who rules over a people willing in the day of His power, and proves in them that He enables them to say, "I delight to do Thy will, O my God," Who says, "Lo, I am with you alway." The abiding presence of the Saviour from sin is promised to all who have accepted Him in the fullness of His redeeming power, and who preach by their lives as well as by their words what a wonderful Saviour He is.
