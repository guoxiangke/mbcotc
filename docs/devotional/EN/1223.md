## PENIEL: FACE TO PACE ##

Scripture: "I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."— GEN. xxxii. 30.



In these words of Jacob, uttered after he had become Israel, a Prince with God, we find expression of that which prayer meant to him. The words show us what each child of God, through the grace of God, and the power of the Holy Ghost, may experience each day. God will cause His face to shine upon us; •we shall see Him face to face, and be delivered.



How often Christians complain that they have so little expe¬rience of what it means to meet with God in prayer, and to feel the light of His countenance upon them. They have done their best, but it seems of no avail. The thoughts of the inner chamber bring a feeling of self-reproach and shame; and yet they feel quite unable' to overcome this disappointment.



Dear children of God, I bring you the message that your Father in heaven is not only willing, but greatly desirous, that the light of His countenance shall rest upon you. Perhaps the words of this book may be a help to you, by giving you that assurance. If we can find out what the reason is that you cannot break through in your prayers that you may see God face to face, then we shall know what you need in order to make your inner chamber a true Peniel. Only there will you realize what it is to meet with God, to see His face, and to feel how certain and blessed it is that His love rests upon you.



Begin with the prayer: "Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts, cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved" (Ps. Ixxx. 19), and meditate on the words. Believe firmly that you may know the power and truth of this text—only then will you be able to say with Jacob: "I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved." Remember how Jacob reached this point. He had learned to say: "7 will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me." Persevering prayer is needed to bring the soul into the steadfast conviction that God will really make Himself known.
