## THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE SPIRIT ##

Scripture: "The Communion of the Holy Ghost be with you."—2 COR. xiii. 14.



In this verse we have one of the chief characteristics and activities of the Holy Spirit. It is the Holy Spirit through whom the Father and Son are one, and through whom they have fellowship with each other in the Godhead. For the Holy Spirit is the true life of the Godhead.



We have fellowship with the Father and the Son through the Spirit. "Our fellowship is with the Father and the Son." "Hereby know we that He abideth in us, by the Spirit which He has given us" (1 John iii. 24). Through the Spirit we know and experience the fellowship of love in the life with the Father and Son.



Through the Spirit we, as God's children, have fellowship one with another. In the child of God there should be nothing of the selfishness and self-interest that seeketh its own welfare. We are members of one Body. "It is one Body and one Spirit." And through the Spirit the unity of the Body must be maintained. One reason that the Spirit does not work with greater power in the Church is that the unity of the Spirit is too little sought after. At Pentecost, after ten days spent in united prayer, the one hundred and twenty seemed melted together into one body. They received the Spirit in fellowship with one another.



We have the fellowship in the bread and wine when we meet at the Communion-table; we have also fellowship one with another in the trials of other members of the Body. Always it is: "The fel¬lowship of the Spirit be with you now and evermore." Remember the words of the text in Galatians about the fruits of the Spirit, and present it to the Spirit in prayer, and so make manifest our love for all God's children.



In heaven there is an eternal fellowship of love between Father and Son through the Spirit. Do we really long to be filled with the Spirit ? Let us offer ourselves to God, beseeching Him to grant us the unity and the fellowship of the Spirit with all mem¬bers of Christ's Body.
