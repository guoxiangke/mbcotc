## BETTER PROMISES ##

Scripture: "He is the Mediator of a better Covenant, which hath been enacted upon better promises."—HEB. viii. 6."Ye are come to Jesus the Mediator of a New Covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling."—HEB. xii. 24.



We have here some of the better promises of the New Covenant. Jer. xxxi. 33: "This is the covenant: I will put My law in their inward parts, and in their hearts will I write it." Jer. xxxii. 40: "I will put My fear in their hearts, and they will not depart from Me." Ezk. xxxvi. 25, 27: "From all your filthiness will I cleanse you, and I will give you a new heart, and I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and ye shall keep My judgments to do them." Ezk. xxxvi. 36: "/ the Lord have spoken it, and I will do it. For this moreover will I be enquired of by the house of Israel to do it for them."



Could there be better or more definite promises than these, that God Himself would put His fear into the hearts of His people so absolutely that they would not depart from Him, and that He would cause them to keep His judgments and do them ?



This is the New Covenant of which Jesus is Mediator. Through the Holy Spirit He dwells in us and will keep us from sin, so that we shall have the desire and the power to do God's will in all things. Think of Zacharias's inspired words as he prophesied the deliverance Christ would bring. Luke i. 74: "That we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies should serve Him without fear in holiness and righteousness before Him all our days." These are the words of God and show what He will do for those who enquire of Him. The promises are sure. The Mediator gave first His blood and then His Spirit. He sees to it that the better promises are fulfilled to those who whole-heartedly and confidently desire and claim them from Him. Alas, how seldom is such a life either preached or experienced!
