## THE POWER OF INTERCESSION ##

Scripture: "We will continue steadfastly in prayer."—ACTS vi. 4. "Prayer was made earnestly of the Church unto God for him."— ACTS xii. 5.



Dr. Mott urges us to believe in the unlimited power of united intercession. In travelling in Asia he was charged by men who have penetrated most deeply into the heart of the problem to press upon the missionary societies the imperative need of more intercession—above all, of united intercession. "We can in no way better serve the deepest interest of the Churches than by multiplying the number of real intercessors, and by focus¬ing the prayers of Christendom upon those great situations which demand the almighty working of the Spirit of God. Far more im¬portant and vital than any service we can render to missions is that of helping to release the superhuman energy of prayer, and, through uniting in this holy ministry true intercessors of all lands, to help the ushering in of a new era abounding in signs and wonders characteristic of the working of the living Christ. Immeasurably more important than any other work is the linking of all we do to the fountain of Divine life and energy. The Christian world has not only a right to expect mission leaders to set forth the facts and methods of the work, but also a larger discovery of superhuman resources and a greater irradiation of spiritual power."



And where is there a greater need of focusing the united intercession of Christendom than on the great army of Missionaries, of whom we spoke in our Introduction? They confess the need of the presence and the power of God's Spirit in their life and work. They long for the experience of the abiding presence and power of Christ every day. They need it; they have a right to it—shall we not, those of us reading this book, make a part of that great army that pleads with God for that enduement of power which is so absolutely necessary for effective work? Shall we not, like the early Apostles, "continue steadfastly in prayer," until God sends an abundant answer? As we give ourselves continually to prayer, the power of the promise, "Lo, I am with you alway," will be proved in our lives.
