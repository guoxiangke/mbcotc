## THE THRICE-HOLY GOD ##

Scripture: "The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is He that calleth you, who will also do it."â€”1 THESS. v. 23, 24.



What inexhaustible words! The God of peace Himself. Yes, He Himself, and none other, can and will do the work. And what is this work? To sanctify you wholly. How is this work to be done? Your entire spirit and soul, and even your body, is to be preserved without blame at the coming of our Lord.



This promise is so great it appears incredible. The Apostle feels the difficulty and adds the words, "Faithful is He that calleth you, who will also do it." That leaves no room for doubt, but calls us to place our confidence in the faithfulness of God.



This work is accomplished by the Holy Trinity. God the Father says, "Be ye holy, for I am holy. I am the Lord that sanctifieth you." The Son prayed, "For their sakes, I sanctify myself that they also may be sanctified in the truth." And the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of sanctification, through whom the Church of God consists of the sanctified ones in Christ Jesus.

How does the Thrice-holy God accomplish this great work of sanctifying us wholly? Through His continual indwelling and fellowship and breathing of His holy life into us. As upon a cold day a man may warm himself by standing in the rays of the sun, until its warmth penetrates his body, so the soul who takes time for communion with God becomes permeated with the strength of the Triune Holiness.



Oh, my brother, what a treasure there is in these words, what cause for adoration, what confidence that God, who is faithful, will do it. What encouragement to wait upon Him, to walk with Him, as Abraham did, knowing God, being fully assured that what He had promised He was able to perform. God grant us a vision of this divine holiness and grace and power, that we may confidently feel that He will sanctify us wholly and preserve spirit, soul and body without blame.
