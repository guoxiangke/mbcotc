## WALK IN THE SPIRIT ##

Scripture: "Walk in the Spirit . . . If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit."â€”GAL. v. 16, 25.



The word "walk" reminds us of daily life with our fellow-men. The Christian in his walk and conversation must follow the leading of the Spirit, and walk by the Spirit. That will be the sign of the spiritual man, who serves God in the Spirit, and does not trust in the flesh.



People speak as though the Spirit were only needed in our intercourse with God when we pray, or for our work in the service of the Kingdom. This is a great mistake. God gives us His Spirit to be in us the whole day. We need Him most in the midst of our daily work, because the world has then such power to lead us away from God. We need to pray the Father every morning for a fresh portion of His Spirit for each day. During the course of the day let us remind ourselves that the Spirit is with us, and lift up our hearts to God, remembering that the Spirit abides with us always.



Paul says: "As ye have received Christ Jesus our Lord, so walk ye in Him"; and again: "Put on the Lord Jesus Christ." As I put on my cloak when I go out, so the Christian must put on the Lord Jesus, and show by his conduct that Christ lives in him, and that he walks by the Spirit.



"Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh." As long as we are not under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the flesh will rule over us. Oh, that we knew the unspeakable value of the grace that God has given! The Spirit of His Son in our hearts will cry "Abba, Father," so that we may walk the whole day in God's presence as His beloved children. Christian, learn this lesson: the Spirit is given you to teach you that you may walk by the Spirit at all times. Thank God continually for this Divine Leader, who gives us daily renewal from heaven, and enables us to walk and to abide in Christ.
