## THE TRIAL OF FAITH ##

Scripture: "And Naaman's servants came near, and spake unto him, and said: 'My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldst thou not have done it? How much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?' "—2 KINGS v. 13.



In Naaman we have a striking Old Testament illustration of the place faith takes in God's dealing with man. It gives us a wonderful discovery of what faith really is. Think first of how intense the desire was for healing on Naaman's part. He would do anything, appeal to the King of Syria and the King of Israel; he would undertake a long journey and humble himself before the prophet, who did not even deign to come out and see him. In this intensity of desire for blessing we have the root of a strong faith. And it is just this seeking for God and His blessing which is too much lacking in our religion.



The second mark of faith is that it has to give up all its preconceived opinion and to bow before the word of God. This was more than Naaman was willing to do, and he turned away in a rage. It was well for him that a wise and faithful servant gave him, better advice. Faith is often held back by the thought how such a simple thing as to accept God's word can effect such a mighty revolution in the heart.



And then comes the third mark of faith. It submits implicitly to the word of God: "Wash, and be clean." At first all appears vain, but faith proves itself in obedience. It does it not once or twice, but seven times in the assurance that the mighty wonder will be wrought. It takes the simple word, "Wash, and be clean," and lo, it finds itself renewed as with the life of a little child, "clean, every whit." The mighty deed is done.



When God's word brings us to the promise: "I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean; from all your filthiness will I cleanse you," it is nothing but unbelief that holds us back. Let us believe that a simple determined surrender of the whole will to God's promise will indeed bring the heart-cleansing we need. "There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God." It flows from under the throne of God and the Lamb, through the channels of a thou¬sand precious promises, and at each step the word is heard: "Wash, and be clean." Christ cleanses "by the washing of water with the Word." Every promise is a call: "Wash, and be clean; Wash, and be clean"; and Christ will speak: "Ye are clean through the word that I have spoken unto you"— clean, every whit.
