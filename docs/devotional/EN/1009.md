## LED BY THE SPIRIT ##

Scripture: "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God."—ROM. viii. 14.



Let us now consider four other fruits of the Spirit: Long-suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Meekness. These four words all denote attributes of the Godhead. They will reach maturity in us through much prayer for the working of the Holy Spirit. Think of what they mean.



Long-suffering.—In the Old Testament, in the time of Moses, God's long-suffering was praised. All Scripture bears witness to the wonderful patience with which God dealt with sinful man, until we come to the word in 2 Pet. iii. 9: "The Lord is long-suffering, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance." This attribute of God, the Spirit will make a characteristic of our lives, so that we too may exercise a divine patience with all sin and wrong, so that souls may be saved.



Gentleness.—What wonderful things we read in the Psalms about God's goodness and gentleness, which are from everlasting to everlasting. "As the heavens are high above the earth, so great is His mercy towards them that fear Him." God works in our hearts this same goodness and mercy towards all the sin and wretchedness around us.



Goodness.—"There is none good but God." All goodness comes from Him, and He gives to His children according as each heart asks and desires. And this goodness is manifested in sym¬pathy and love to all who are in need.



Meekness.—We read in Ps. xviii. 35: "Thy gentleness hath made me great." But it was chiefly in God's Son that the divine meekness was shown. Jesus says: "Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly of heart." Paul entreats his readers "by the gentleness and meekness of Christ." The Holy Spirit, too, the gentle Dove, longs to impart the ripe fruit of meekness to our hearts.



Is it not a wonderful thought that these four attributes of God, which are the characteristics of God's work amongst sinners, may be brought to ripeness in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, so that we in all our ways and conversation may be like the Meek and Lowly One?
