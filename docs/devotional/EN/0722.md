## THE POWER OF OBEDIENCE ##

Scripture: "Pie that hath sent Me is with Me; He hath not left Me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to Him."—, JOHN viii. 29.



In these words Christ not only tells what His life with the Father was, but reveals at the same time the law of all intercourse with God—simple obedience.



How strongly He insisted upon it we see in the Farewell Discourse. In chap. xiv. He says three times: "If ye love Me, keep My commandments. And then I will pray the Father, and He will give you the Holy Spirit, and the Father will love you, and I will love you and manifest Myself to you, and then we will make Our abode with you." And so three times over in chap. xv.: "If My words abide with you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you"; "If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love; even as I kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love"; "Ye are My friends, if ye do the things which I command you."



Obedience is the proof and the exercise of the love of God that has been shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. It comes from love and leads to love, a deeper and a fuller experience of God's love and indwelling. It assures us that what we ask will be given us. It assures us that we are abiding in the love of Christ. It seals our claim to be called the friends of Christ. And so it is not only a proof of love but of faith too, as assuring us that we "ask and receive because we keep His com¬mandments, and do the things that are pleasing in His sight."



For the abiding enjoyment of the Holy Presence, simple, full obedience is necessary. The New Covenant has made full provision for this: "I will write My law in their hearts; I will put My fear in their heart, that they may not depart from Me"; "I will cause them to walk in My statutes and to keep them."



Blessed obedience, that enables us to abide in His love and gives the full experience of His unbroken presence. Christ did not speak of an impossibility; He saw what in the power of the Spirit we might confidently expect. Let the thought take deep hold of us, It is to the obedient that the word comes, "Lo, I am with you alway," and to whom all the fullness of its meaning will be revealed.
