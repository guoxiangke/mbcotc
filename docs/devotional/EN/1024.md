## SPIRITUAL OR CARNAL? ##

Scripture: "And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ."—1 COR. iii. 1.v



The Apostle here uses three words describing the spiritual condition of a man. There .is the natural man, in his uncon¬verted state—one who cannot "receive the things of the Spirit of God" (1 Cor. ii. 14). There is "the spiritual man, who can dis¬cern spiritual things" (1 Cor. ii. 13, 14). And between the two there is the carnal man, who is called "a babe in Christ," and who lives in jealousy and strife (1 Cor. iii. 3).



It is important for us to know whether we are carnal Christians, giving way to sin and the lusts of the flesh. With the thought that things cannot be otherwise, we are apt to be content to allow much that is sinful and wrong in our lives. God calls us, and the Spirit draws us, to be spiritual men and women—that is to say, people who pray each day to be led and guided each day into a truly spiritual life.



When the Lord Jesus promised the Spirit to His disciples, it was in the full expectation that they would yield themselves wholly to the leading and power of the Spirit. And it is in the same expectation that the Spirit will be granted anew each day, if we yield ourselves unreservedly to be sanctified in all our walk and conversation. Oh, that our eyes were open to see how right and how blessed this is!



Many Christians pray for the Holy Spirit, but always with a certain reservation, for they intend in many things still to do their own will. Oh, Christian, when you pray, entrust yourself fully to the guidance of the Holy Spirit for the whole day. If there is true willingness on your part, then the Holy Spirit will take full possession of you, and will preserve and sanctify your life. Do not serve God half-heartedly. Pray for the enlightenment of the Spirit, that you may see the possibility and the blessedness of a life wholly surrendered to His service.
