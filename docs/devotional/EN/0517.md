## THE FIRST PRAYER-MEETING ##

Scripture: "These all with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer, with the women."—ACTS i. 14.



The sixth mark of the early Church—waiting on the promise of the Father in united prayer.



It is difficult to form a right conception of the unspeakable importance of this first prayer-meeting in the history of the Kingdom, a prayer-meeting which was the simple fulfilling of the command of Christ. It was to be for all time the indication of the one conditions on which His Presence and Spirit would he known in Power. In it we have the secret key that opens the storehouse of heaven with all its blessings.



Christ had prayed that the disciples might be one. even as He and the Father were one—perfect in one—that the world might know that God loved them as He loved Christ. How far the disciples were from such a state when Christ prayed the prayer, we see in the strife that there was among them at the Lord's Table as to who would be chief. It was only after the resurrection and after Christ had gone to heaven, that they would be brought, in the ten days of united supplication, to that holy unity of love and of purpose which would make them the one Body of Christ prepared to receive the Spirit in all His power.



What a prayer-meeting! The fruit of Christ's training during His three years' intercourse with them. Adam's body , was first created, before God breathed His spirit into him. And so the Body of Christ had first to be formed ere the Spirit took possession.



This prayer-meeting gives us the law of the Kingdom for all time. Where Christ's disciples are linked to each other in love, and yield themselves wholly to Him in undivided consecration, the Sprit will be given from heaven as the seal of God's approval, and Christ will show His mighty power. One of the great marks of the new dispensation is the united unceasing prayer that avail-eth much, and is crowned with the power of the Holy Spirit. Have we not here the reason why, if our prayers are confined in great measure to our own church or interests, the answer cannot come in such power as we expected ?
