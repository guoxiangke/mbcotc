## THE SPIRIT IN PREACHER AND HEARER ##

Scripture: "Our Gospel came unto you . . . in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance . . . Having received the Word . . . with joy of the Holy Ghost."—1 THESS. i. 5, 6. (See also 1 Cor. ii. 4, 5.)



Paul more than once reminds his converts that the chief characteristic of his preaching was the power—the supernatural power of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Spirit was so imparted to his hearers that they received the Word "with joy of the Holy Ghost."



This is one of the most important lessons in the spiritual life. We, as hearers, are so accustomed to listen attentively to the sermon to see what it has to teach us, that we are apt to forget that the blessing of our church-going depends on two things. First, the prayer for the preacher that he may speak "in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power," and then the prayer for the congregation and for ourselves, that we may receive the Word, not from man, but as it is in truth, God's Word, "which effectually worketh in you that believe" (1 Thess. ii. 13.) How often there is no mani¬festation of the Spirit, when both the speaking and the hearing are mainly the work of human understanding or feeling. So often there is no power that raises the soul with spiritual insight into the life of faith that God has provided for His children.



How earnestly we should pray that God may reveal to us all, both minister and people, "the Spirit of wisdom and revelation," that we may discover what the place really is that the Holy Spirit should have in our lives, and what the perfect work is that He will do within us! God help us to learn this prayer! Then we shall understand what Christ meant when He said: "Go not, preach not—but wait for the promise of the Father, and ye shall receive the power of the Spirit, and ye shall be My witnesses unto the uttermost part of the earth" (Acts i. 4, 8).



Pray earnestly that God may teach us to pray down the power of the Holy Spirit upon ministers and missionaries and their congregations, that the preaching may be in the manifestation of the Spirit and of power, for the conversion and sanctification of souls.
