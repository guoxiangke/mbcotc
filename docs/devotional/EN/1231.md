## LOVE DEMANDS ALL ##

Scripture: "Hereby know -we love, because He laid down His life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren."— 1 JOHN iii. 16.



It was not only on the Cross that Christ gave His life for us: that was the consummation of a life that from the beginning was surrendered to the service and healing of man. The debt that rests upon each one of us as a consequence is not discharged if we are called upon suddenly to lay down our life. The example of Christ bids us give our whole life in service to our brethren.



Try to grasp this truth. The strength of God's love in Christ enabled Him to give up His life wholly for us. The same strength is available for us, and as we yield ourselves wholly to it we shall be able to make the welfare of souls the central object of our lives. One who gives himself wholly into the keeping of God's love will feel its power and all-sufficiency. This is the blessedness of the Christian life—giving our lives wholly for others even as Christ did.



One sometimes finds, even among unlearned people, that where the fire of love to Christ burns there is an unquenchable desire to pray and work for others. I read lately a story of a young girl only ten years of age, whose heart had been so touched by the love of Christ that she began at once to lead others to Him. A few years later, when she went to a boarding-school, it was her daily prayer and endeavor to bring others to know and love her Saviour. This continued until her nineteenth year, when she became a regular worker among soldiers, giving all her time and energy to the work. The Lord gave her such a spirit of prayer and such love to souls that for many years she continued that work, a living example to all of how God could enable one to spend her life in the service of others, and specially in winning them for Christ.



Dear reader, take this thought into your heart. Christ gave His life for you and you are a debtor who owes his life to the brethren. The love of Christ constrains you and will supply all the power and strength needed.
